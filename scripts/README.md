Scripts
============

Here you can find all the scripts that are part of the Kolaborativa application to understand and make use of them.

routes.py
--------------

The routes of the Kolaborativa app **are not** automatic. Then, you will have to set manualy the pages of the application every time a new one is created. You can do that using **REGEX**.

The **routes.py** should be placed on the web2py directory, outside the Kolaborativa application and even outside the applications folder. This way:
	> web2py/routes.py
